# Development & Installation Guides

## Getting up & running

Installing git

## Developing the finopspp CLI tool

If you use VSCode, or would like to, you can follow the tutorial from <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial> to get started with setting up this python project environment.

> **NOTE**: The parts related to installing python and activating an existing venv should also work with pretty much any other IDE or text editor. So you are under no obligation to us VSCode if you have another coding tool like Vim, Emacs, PyCharm, Cursor, etc.

It is also recommended to read through <https://realpython.com/python-pyproject-toml/> to get an overview of `pyproject.toml` based python projects. And to get a feel for the setup of this project in [pyproject.toml](/pyproject.toml) used for `finopspp`.
