# Action Scoring Guide

Each of our actions is required to have a score that is objective in order to assess FinOps maturity and benchmark against peers. 
These scores come in a variety of formats that are deemed acceptable for use in the assessment by way of being an objective measurement.
New scoring formats are always welcome and can be submitted for review to be added to this list and for specific action scores.
Below we list each of the approved scoring formats and detail how to construct new action scores that align with each format.
