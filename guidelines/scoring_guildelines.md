# Action Scoring Guide

Each of our actions is required to have a score that is objective in order to assess FinOps maturity and benchmark against peers. 
These scores come in a variety of formats that are deemed acceptable for use in the assessment by way of being an objective measurement.
New scoring formats are always welcome and can be submitted for review to be added to this list and for specific action scores.
Below we list each of the approved scoring formats and detail how to construct new action scores that align with each format. 

# 1. Bucket of Accomplishments
For actions that aim to measure how proficient a team is at a managerial or operational task, there are often no numerical values applicable to be used in a formula.
Therefore, to measure maturity of these actions, we create a list of necessary tasks that are included in mature FinOps practices.
These are not comprehensive tasks for an action, but represent tasks that lead to higher maturity of the action, and subsequent capabilities.
These tasks are unordered, meaning that different orgs can achieve the same score for the action via different tasks.
This is because there isn't just one way to reach maturity, and we wanted to leave flexibility for teams to choose their own path to get there.

# 2. Percentage Calculation
This scoring method is straightforward. This score applies when there is a clear path to completion by iterating on the same task until all iterations are exhausted.
For example, percent of resources that are deployed with a mandatory tag, or percent of teams complying with a policy, etc. 

# 3. Other Mathematical Formulae
If there is a way to get a consistent, reliable numerical value to measure progress on an action, we can use that number in a formula to measure maturity.
There are no restrictions as of yet for what the formula could consist of, as long as the result is objective and repeatable.
We welcome submissions of any scores that have a mathematical formula similar or different from any currently listed in the assessment.
