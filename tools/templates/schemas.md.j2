# Component Specification Schemas

This document includes the schemas for all the main specifications used by FinOps++. The schemas
are all produced via the [Pydantic JSON Schema](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json_schema/) and follow both the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html). Importantly,
the outputs are in [YAML format](https://yaml.org/). This choice was made in order to follow the usage of yaml in the specifications used by FinOps++. It also
matches exactly the output that comes from running the `finopspp specifications schema` command. These schemas are created As-Code under
[definitions](../tools/models/definitions.py). All component specifications are validated against these definitions, and new component specifications
can be created from them. Commands for these can be found in [CLI Tool](../tools/README.md#cli-tool) of the README.

## Action

Base component used by FinOps++. Can be composed into groups of Capabilities. Example: [Action - 000.yaml](./actions/000.yaml)

```yaml
{{ schemas.action }}
```

## Capability

Component attempts to create a first-order logical grouping of Actions. Can be composed into groups of Domains.
Example: [Capability - 000.yaml](./capabilities/000.yaml)

```yaml
{{ schemas.capability }}
```

## Domain

Components attempts to create a second-order logical grouping of Actions, by categorizing Capabilities.
Can be composed into Profiles. Example: [Domain - 000.yaml](./domains/000.yaml)

```yaml
{{ schemas.domain }}
```

## Profile

The top-level logical grouping of Actions. While not really a component itself, a Profile defines a
complete "menu" of Actions grouped by Domains, and then Capabilities. These menus can then be scoped
down for specific use cases. Example: [Profile - 000.yaml](./profiles/000.yaml)

```yaml
{{ schemas.profile }}
```
