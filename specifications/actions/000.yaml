Specification:
  ID: 0
  Title: Title of specification

    If given, this formula is used to calculate the condition for the score

    Can be an equation or series of equations that feed into a final value
    or range of values
  Scoring: # scoring is a set of treatments for meeting a certain score value. Max value is 10, min is 0
  - Score: 0 # Scores and conditions must be unique to an action.

  Notes:
  - |-
    Example of a note directly relating to the specification. Could be over implementation or
    related to discussion over tweaks to the maturity model. These notes could come from
    external sources and were selected for inclusion based on their importance. Such as if
    they provide clarification on some aspect of a particular specification.

    Another example of a note on the specification. Is over information not in Description. It
    is meant to be a multiline string using the folded scalar syntax of YAML. For
